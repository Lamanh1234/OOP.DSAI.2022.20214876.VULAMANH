Question in Lab03:

Q1: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
ANS:
Because when you pass 2 object JungleDVD and cinderellaDVD, you pass 2 reference varibale containing 2 address of JungleDVD and cinderellaDVD. Then 2 varibale o1 and o2 is the copy of those reference variable . Therefore, when you swap o1 and o2, you just swap 2 value of o1 and o2, but don't actually affect to the 2 object JungleDVD and CinderellaDVD.

Q2: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed? 
It changed because local variable dvd is the copy of reference varibale of JungleDVD, then dvd contains the address of JungleDVD -> dvd points to object JungleDVD. Inside the method, we use dvd.SetTitle(), then we can directly change the title of JungleDVD to title of cinderellaDVD.
